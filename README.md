# PythonTraining

Recreate Minesweeper Backend Code

I did this Senior Year in High School with a extremely basic level of programming in Python. After completeting a few college courses in
java, I want to revisit this using my new skills.

I'm currently re-learning python syntax so the start of this will be pretty slow. I'll paste my current back end code. Expect huge change
for everything in the program. From variable names, to better comments, and possible data structure usage.
